Weather Forecasting
#Dataset
This weather forecasting dataset appears to contain various meteorological measurements and environmental conditions recorded at different locations over a period of time. Here's some information about the dataset columns:

DATE: The date of the recorded data.
MONTH: The month of the recorded data.
Location-specific columns (e.g., BASEL, BUDAPEST, DE_BILT): These columns contain weather-related measurements specific to each location. The measurements include cloud cover, humidity, pressure, global radiation, precipitation, sunshine duration, and temperature statistics such as mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures.
Other location-specific columns (e.g., DRESDEN, DUSSELDORF, HEATHROW): Similar to the previous set of columns, these also contain weather-related measurements for different locations.
Additional columns: Some additional columns seem to contain weather-related measurements for other locations such as KASSEL, LJUBLJANA, MALMO, etc. These measurements include wind speed, wind gust, humidity, pressure, global radiation, precipitation, and temperature statistics.
Overall, this dataset appears to be comprehensive and suitable for weather forecasting and analysis tasks. It covers a wide range of meteorological variables and spans multiple locations, which could be valuable for various applications such as climate modeling, agricultural planning, and weather prediction.
